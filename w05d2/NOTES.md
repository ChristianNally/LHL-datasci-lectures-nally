Some Relevant Quotes
====================

“It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as 
simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of 
experience.” - Einstein

Logistic Regression
===================

Today we're going to:

a) build out our INTUITION about some algorithms
( dots on a scatter plot, lines on a plane, hyperplanes in n-dimensions, ...)

b) take a peak at some actual ALGEBRA which helps to feed 
our understanding (i.e. trust and mistrust) of those algorithms

c) grow and practice our vocabulary around classification algorithms
(precision, accuracy, log-odds, probability, sigmoid function, ... )
