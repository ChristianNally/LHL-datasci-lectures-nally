Logistic Regression
===================

Today we're going to:

a) build out our INTUITION about some algorithms
( dots on a scatter plot, lines on a plane, hyperplanes in n-dimensions, ...)

b) take a peak at some actual ALGEBRA which helps to feed 
our understanding (i.e. trust and mistrust) of those algorithms

c) grow and practice our vocabulary around classification algorithms
(precision, accuracy, log-odds, probability, sigmoid function, ... )
